# Pitchfork Album Scraper

## Description

Very basic web scraper that uses the selenium and beautiful soup (bs4) Python libraries in order to pull and display data from Pitchfork's website. The program currently retrieves and prints out the five most recent albums (including artist name, album name, and score) that are displayed on [this page](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/best/albums/?page=1). I was just looking to experiment with these technologies to get a better sense of how they work.

## How To Use

The selenium/bs4 libraries and Firefox must be installed prior to use. Simply running the program will retrieve and display the data.
